- add Chat.delete(), Chat.send_image() and Chat.send_file()

- renamed Chat.send_text_message to Chat.send_text()
  (all other send methods also have no "_msg" at the end
  as it's pretty clear Chat.send_X is going to send a message
  to the chat)

- new Account.create_message() to create new messages 
  that are not in the database (yet)

- initial release with full low level C-API, and a first
  high level API
